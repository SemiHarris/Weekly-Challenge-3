# Weekly-Challenge-3

-I had to create a password generator that had to be 8-128 characters and also allow for upercase and lower case letter, numbers, and symbols

-I used multiple arrays to store the information that I needed for the password

-I used 2 for loops to cycle through the arrays and grab infromation

-I used web API's to send the result of the functions back to the html to be displayed
